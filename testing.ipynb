As moderators it very much looks like you are forcing your opinion on all the other 99.999% of users. As, I said, I do support third-party apps to an extent (I originally paid for Apollo), but I spend most of my time on Reddit in a browser and the rest using the official Reddit app. This is the same for literally every other Reddit user I know personally.

      "I like the approach of going private for 2 days and then keeping it locked after that. Making the subreddit totally disappear will defeat the purpose.

      "But the reality is that some number of Redditors still won't know/don't care and if it can be explained as \"Overbearing Admins block everyday Redditors from using the platform\", that's not a strong statement. A better statement would be \"Redditors en masse stop posting, despite all communities remaining open\" (a proper grassroots movement). Now, obviously this is hard to organize...

That said, at the end of the day, I strongly disagree with the 'censor the subreddit' tactic. If there's actual solidarity on reddit, then people will choose not to come here, they will choose not to post, and they will choose not to comment. If everyone is right that this calamitous for reddit, you don't need to close the subreddits. Market forces will close the subreddits (and reddit itself eventually). No one will be here because they all individually made the decision to delete whatever apps they use or delete their accounts. If moderators are frustrated with the potential loss of mod tools, then they should organize, and as one body say \"Hey, I'm done moderating. reddit can find itself new moderators who want to do the job,\" and release the sub to someone else. And if reddit can't find replacements, well, that's a problem for reddit because the market has spoken and no one wants to run their forums. \n",
      "\n",
      "I say all of the above having been on (and having left) Digg, Xanga, LiveJournal, MySpace, Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, and probably more that I can't think of right now.  I didn't leave any of those because a small group of people turned off my access to the common parts of the site.  I left them because they all made decisions that I disliked, and like many people, I stopped using the site.  That's my position on reddit right now.  Let the users vote with their own wallets, their own eyes and their own feet.  If these changes are that problematic, then people will leave without moderators taking it upon themselves to silence entire swaths of the user base.  Doing that feels like a small group of power-users saying \"If we don't get our way, nobody can play on reddit.\"  That's a problem, and I profoundly disagree with that approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "This subreddit has over a million users. As of this moment, about 350 people have left comments about this.  That means a decision impacting all million plus users of this sub is potentially directed by a core of around 0.03% of r/python's users.   I don't think you should censor the other 99.97% of users on their behalf.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also don't believe this protest will be effective aside from maybe fracturing some reddit communities.  Maybe that's your goal in protesting, but that feels like poor stewardship on the part of a subreddit leadership that represents one of the largest programming subreddits on here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason I say that has to do with the way reddit runs generally.  If r/python goes dark, most people won't know it.  If you go to r/all on the 12th, it will still be full of new posts from a wide variety of subreddits.  They may not be from the 'default' or 'typical' subs, but reddit isn't going to be a wasteland.  The 'going dark' movement is going to cause a bunch of unknown subs to balloon in popularity.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If you generally subscribe to a lot of subreddits, your own homepage is going to do the same.  All of those smaller subreddits will have an influx of users, and it will just push out the subs that go dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the only particular impact would be for users looking specifically for r/python.  r/python isn't the only python subreddit.  If those users see this one is dark, they'll just go to the next one that's open.  The biggest effect of that is some people might have a slightly more annoying time trying to solve a coding problem, and they will be left with a bad taste in their mouth about r/python (or maybe Python more generally if they are looking for new coder support).  I've been here for a long time, and I would hate to see this wonderful sub get pulled into partisanship and bickering.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of that said, I hope you make the decision to keep r/python open to the public.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for your time.\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Yes\n",
