I am now a fully grown adult male that has a successfully raised a family and been married to the same woman going on 37 years now.

Parents fighting all the time, picked on at school (but never backed down so beat up a lot too) i used to contemplate running away and/or suicide to ‚Äúpunish‚Äù my parents. I was strong willed tho and determined that a better outcome would be to succeed as best i could. I left home a few weeks before my 16th birthday, I went to an oilfield company and asked for job. I was told I was too young but once I really laid out my situation and the fact I really needed a break the supervisor I was talking to talked to another equal and they decided I could work part time in the tire shop, repairing flats etc. on the trucks. I worked hard, gained respect from the other guys by being so young and determined. I won‚Äôt bore you with all the details but the sheer determination I walked into my life with helped me feel a great sense of satisfaction for myself.  I moved on to bigger construction work, high rise iron work, welding, etc. and now, all these years later I feel great about having taken lemons and making some sweet ass lemonade.

Great machines, Im not saying they aren't, just won't work for what we do. We need a class 9 or larger. Plus with the hopper extensions on the power fold we can get 500bu on that bad boy. Helps a lot when we are running two 12 row machines with one 1500 bu cart. Especially when the rows are a half mile long. Gotta get all you can.

I worked in gleaners for a couple years, I really liked the machines and thought they were a breeze to work on. I love the design of the threshing system and appreciate that they don't add a bunch of unnecessary crap. We are in a time crunch like any other farmer, and we used to run three 9770s side by side in corn, now we can run the two s690s and push damn near the same capacity. The speed increase was insane. 

Btw, trust me when I say, I tried my best to get them to buy the gleaners. We curse about it sometimes when we have break downs. We all know how great of a machine they are, just not what we needed. Also, the AGCO dealer was out a few days ago and said he would bring a Fendt out to demo this fall. I think upper management is pretty against them, but you never know.",1,t1_jviclsv

Unfortunately I just don't think they would have the capacity for what we put through our Deere's. We demoed one last year with a 12 row drago just like ours and we just couldn't get the speed or unload rate we got with the 690s. We would probably have bought a couple if they could have matched Deere. We just don't have time to take forever to unload in a cart, or slow down anymore. Sounds like minor issues, but when we stepped up from 9770s to 690s, it saves so much time and we gained a lot more ground with  the extra 2mph and faster unload time. 

We thought about Fendt, but their electronics have went way overboard. I haven't heard many good things about those machines. I see a lot of them for sale, and not a lot being run. 

If anyone has any feedback on running the Fendt I would be happy to hear how you feel about them. 

The more emissions and electronic shit they stuff into a machine the more issues you're gonna have. More stuff to break, more stuff to go bad, that's the reality of it. But that's the direction we are headed and it doesn't look like we are turning back anytime soon.

We have had more issues with the local dealership for warranty work and service than we have had problems with the machines. We have a 9760, two 9770s, two s690, and one s790. We run all 12 row heads or 35ft drapers. They get beat on for sure. The 690s have been nothing but problems. We usually do all of our own mechanical work, and I mean everything. But we bought the 690s as a pair and both still under warranty, so we let them work on them. Lost a rear drive hub on both, they replaced the hub on one, and apparently didn't flush the system. Got it back, and within two days the pump went. The system was packed full of metal from the remnants of the hub going out. They replaced the cooler, pump, and tank and said they flushed it for 150 hrs (which sounds like bullshit). They could not get the parts for the second time around. We found the parts in Kansas from a different dealership. The said they woul reimburse us for the cost, they could not pay for them since they weren't under their ownership? Makes no since that they couldn't buy it from a different Deere dealership but they could buy it from us? Total cost to us was $30k. They installed everything, and delivered the combine on may 25th,  we have still yet to get the $30k back. Everyone we talk to there says they have no record of them owing us $30k. We have paperwork on our end, but they do not? I wonder if $30k is worth the couple million they will miss out on next year when we buy some new tractors. They also did an inspection on that machine while it was there, we said for that, but agreed we would do the work at home, we just wanted to get a parts list started. Got it home, looked it over. Found 4 very bad bearings, a hole in the feeder house floor that you could stick your hand in, 4 paddles missing on the clean grain elevator, and one of the batteries was disconnected. They told us the batteries were going bad and we would need new ones. They never even opened the box or they would see they left it disconnected. I personally like the machines, every machine is gonna have issues, especially with the way the electronics are getting. It's the dealership that is causing the most fuss. There is a reason we do our own work and buy equipment just out of warranty. And we rarely get rid of anything.

judsd5b,shatzfan69,shatzfan69,t3_15fka18,t5_2qrz8,1690917631.0,"A friend of mine, who lives a few miles away, grows around 500 plants every year. He works during the summer and can easily afford to take off all winter. He uses drip irrigation, and has a buyer that takes the whole buds after he harvests, dries and cures it in old refer trailers(name is fitting, lol).  This hemp is used for medicinal purposes and not sold as bales. I think if growing hemp, in a small area, with no major equipment, that would be the way to make money from it. It has a ton of uses, it's extremely strong for cloth and paper at the least. The company he sells it to in bulk processes it and makes gummies, tinctures, and vape pods, and also sells it as flower for smoking. The CBD from the hemp has lots of medical uses. I use his products for chronic pain in my neck. Seems to be the only thing that reduces the inflammation and pain and allows me to sleep without side effects or a ""high"".

I think if there was a better infrastructure for processing and manufacturing goods from hemp, the market would be much better and more farmers may take a risk on it. It's just not to that point yet. For medicinal uses it seems profitable, but for bulk harvesting it is not there yet. I think one of the reasons is because manufacturers, say for paper, or cloth, already have all the equipment they need to use the original bulk products they were using, without a solid supply of hemp coming in, why would they take a risk on replacing equipment? It grows faster, grows in lots of different places and can hopefully replace most of what we cut trees down for. Not everything of course, but if it was widely used, a lot less trees would be cut down. I think it's a product that is slowly growing in popularity, but here in the US, it doesn't seem to be very profitable yet. 

May not be much of an answer to the question. Most of my knowledge on this subject has come from my friend who has been growing for years, and who originally thought about growing in bulk for bales on the 200 acres of farm land he already has, but that would take a considerable amount of investment for new farm equipment. But he found a way to still grow and make a great profit from it. Also, I think most older folks compare CBD and hemp products to cannabis and think it's pretty much the same thing. My dad, a farmer also, was the same way until I finally got him to try CBD drops, now he doesn't take any pain meds for his back, and he has stopped taking sleeping meds at night. His old busted up knee doesn't bother him much anymore and he has actually started exercising within the last year. He brags about how it's a miracle plant and that we should be using this stuff for pain meds instead of big pharma poison.

One of the other things, if someone is illegally growing cannabis within 5 miles and they somehow end up with a male plant, that pollen can travel to a hemp farm and turn the plants, they will start producing THC, which when growing hemp, is illegal. Basically gotta burn it all or throw it all away. The legal work and government oversite is also very stringent. My friend says they can come to his farm at anytime to test his plants and make sure he is doing everything by the book. That turns a lot of people off. 

Long reply, sorry, but that's all I really know about it.",10,t3_15fka18

The bike already has disc brakes and pretty stiff rear shock and forks. It would be a blast to ride around on my brother's pit bike track at his house. Or playing in the woods. 

Also, I read a comment about gas coming out of your carb? The carburetor should always be mounted level because the float needs to stay parallel to the ground. Another thing from experience with building carts, and back yard toys, the front side of your engine (exhaust side here) should be tilted down around 3-5 degrees for adequate lubrication across the entire engine. That's how they are designed to run. Especially with this being a 2 stroke. A good reference is just to have the bottom of the case parallel to the ground. 

I do love it! Just a tip so nothing burns up!

He was the only one making it about race. I was friends with him in a small way, he would play drums in our little garage band sometimes. He explained to us one day that ever since his dad told him if he pulled the race card every time, he would never be in trouble.

It's a sleeping giant that should have not been awoken. 

Then we have a pandemic, and the dozens of dangerous bio labs spread throughout Ukraine that the US was funding. 

If Mexico was pointing missiles at us, on our southern border, with a massive military build up, you best fucking believe the US would put them in their place. And that's what Russia did to Ukraine. Ukraine is not a NATO member, not yet anyway, the US has absolutely no business defending that corrupt country. Their provocative war has depleted our military resources that will take a decade to restore. If something major happens on US soil, we are all fucked. Thanks to unjust corruption in our government, and Ukraine.

I was missing my alarms totally in the morning and was late to work the first 4 days. So I had to rotate my schedule back a couple hours. So that meant trying to get my kids in bed an hour early and finishing all the household chores two hours(chickens and garden included) early and getting to bed on time. That was tough.
