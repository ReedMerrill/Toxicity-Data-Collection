        "text": "Any parametric model for time series forecasting would help with this. Do you want something that adaptively models multiple KPIs depending on how much investment is made in different areas? I think then the easiest way to go would be to set out a list of things that can be invested in for each KPI and then tweaks things to model how changes occur given a fixed \"budget\". You could have one model for each KPI and take money out of the \"budget\" to change the amount of money put into each KPI's related investment areas. In practice, this would involve making predictions with each model with investment amounts as the values of your independent variables that you're generating a prediction on.\n\nEach model would first need to be trained on at least some of the businesses historical data and you would probably want to make inflation adjustments for your predictions once everything else has been done.",

It is entirely consistent with the bayesian prior that people will be more reluctant to confide in people they know are mandatory reports.\n\nOk, I'll concede that point. From the perspective of church policy I have no issues with mandatory reporting. The church prioritizes stopping ongoing abuse -- regardless of if reporting is mandatory or not.\n\n>Yet 1 study is better than 0 studies. I look forward to additional data.\n\nOne of my issues is that r/dustinsc was using the linked article to make a causal claim, and one study is rarely enough to do that. Sorry for not being clearer, but the authors of that article explicitly state that they can't make causal claims, and at 2%, the differences in reports between mandatory reporting and non-mandatory reporting jurisdictions is quite small.",
