        "text": "I don't think from a humanitarian or moral standpoint it's better for Egypt not to accept them in. From that perspective, which I personally consider the most important perspective, Gazans should be given the option to flee. \n\nOne potentially negative aspect of that is that it might actually increase the attacks. With those gates open, Israel is incentivized to ramp up its assault and get everyone to flee. And the people who don't flee will be blamed for their own deaths, because they could have ran but didn't. But overall, it remains better to offer help to those who desperately need it.\n\nBut it's also not a very realistic expectation, because it's very rare for countries to sacrifice themselves to that extent. It's hard for me to be upset with Egypt for doing what virtually every country in the world would do if they were in Egypt's shoes.\n\nThere's plenty of other reasons to harshly criticize Egypt though.",

There's a very high likelihood that Ukrainian refugees will be able to return to Ukraine. And there's also a lot of countries sharing the responsibility of taking in refugees. \n\nMeanwhile Egypt has been coordinating with Israel and if it opens the borders, it will be seen as an act to facilitate Israel's desire to take over Gaza. Those Palestinians will never be able to return. Nor will the world have much interest in helping them.",

I just made the case for why it makes sense for Egypt not to accept over a million of forcefully displaced people. And I don't know what Palestinian civilians have to be right or wrong about. Existing?\n\nThe joke relating to being a jerk can be true to an extent, but I don't think lots of people and countries snubbing and attacking Jewish people around the WW2 era were indicative of the qualities of those Jewish people. It's not unprecedented for relatively weak people to get fucked by their surroundings.",

Over a million Belgians violently and traumatically get kicked out of their territory into the Netherlands by France with U.S. support. And the Netherlands has close ties with the U.S. and had been collaborating with France.",
