            "text": "It makes perfect sense to consider the U.S. partially responsible. But it's important to understand that the guilt of one party does not mean the other party is innocent. There can be multiple contributors to a conflict. Many conflicts, whether international or in our personal lives, have multiple sides to them. And it's pretty rare for all the mistakes to be purely on one side. The best way to avoid and solve conflicts is to look at ourselves critically and try to face our own mistakes. Solely focusing on the mistakes of others tends to create, extend and escalate conflicts.\n\nWith the invasion of Ukraine, Russia is primarily responsible for pulling the trigger. But that doesn't mean Russia should exclusively face blame for what happened. The United States would do the same if it was in Russia's position. It has invaded much further countries for lesser reasons. It would invade neighbors if they moved towards a military alliance with a U.S. adversary. Hence it is inherently provocative for the United States to proclaim for over a decade that Russia's neighbors would join a U.S. military alliance, and then undertake actions to pursue that goal.\n\nRussia being aggressive and oppressive is not excusable. But neither is it excusable for the U.S. to encourage Ukraine to poke at Russia and call its bluff. If I walk up to an infamous abusive bully and call their mother a whore, they're in the wrong if they attack me. But most people would also question why I would undertake an action that would so predictably and unnecessarily result in a fight.",

When a neighboring country becomes powerful/protected enough to be able to thwart the interests and security of the military empire. This is entirely expected (indeed unjust) behavior for military empires. The United States behaves in this way and Russia behaves in this way.\n\nOftentimes influence campaigns and proxy forces are used before resorting to a major war, which Russia tried to do and was failing at.\n\nI believe you are conveniently pathologizing Russia while excusing the behavior of our own side. In the same way we may be understanding when a loved one punches an adversary in the face, and look for the most forgiving or rational reasons for why it happened. But when an adversary punches a loved one in the face, we look at it very differently and are very willing to believe the person must be sick or evil to commit such a heinous act.\n\nI think the world can only ever make sense and get along if we see each other as human and primarily recognize our own wants and needs in others, while indeed trying to understand cultural differences as well. The idea that we will not tolerate threats near or borders, but Russia should, does not make sense. That's greed and selfishness clouding our vision.",

It's especially easy not to realize it when living in a the world's leading empire.\n\nThe word genocide is highly politicized. You say the genocide in Ukraine is \"incomparable with anything that followed Nazi Germany\". Five times as many people are being killed on a daily basis in Gaza, with a far higher percentage of civilians. Around a million people died in Iraq due to the U.S. invasion. In Vietnam, Yemen and various other U.S. led and backed wars there were more (civilian) deaths than in Ukraine, but somehow those deaths are just less tragic, because a western institution says so.\n\nAnnexation is also peculiar. The U.S. and EU countries are fine with allies annexing territories. The U.S. is also entirely willing to occupy lands. It doesn't annex them, but it tends to keep them until the country is taken over by a puppet regime (as in Iraq). The last time I checked it was still occupying lands in Syria as well. I'm sure Russia would have preferred to install a puppet regime in Ukraine over annexing territories.\n\nIf Russia is comparable to other empires, then we know how to deal with it. The most obvious solution is to consider that Russia does not tolerate things that we do not tolerate ourselves. That should be the basis of any diplomacy, which sadly is far more difficult now than pre-invasion or in the early months of the invasion.\n\nTalking about potential events is always unfalsifiable, as we cannot predict the future or look into alternate timelines. But it is normal and even vital to consider which actions will or would have had which outcomes, based on argumentation. You can disagree with my argumentation, but that doesn't mean I'm not allowed to talk in possibilities. \n\nEuropean leaders did try to avoid it. They were sensible. But European leaders were irrelevant so long as they couldn't get the U.S. to the table. So many people assume European leaders were wrong and the U.S. was right, which is typical aggressive war-time thinking. But the possibility that European leaders were right and the U.S. was wrong is sadly never considered.\n\nPersonally I can't find any logic behind treating the murders by authoritarians different from murders by elected leaders.",

Russia is not solely concerned about being directly attacked by NATO. Through encirclement, Russia can be choked economically (including through blockades), intimidated with advanced weapons pointed at it, and it becomes more vulnerable to infiltration and influence operations. And if the U.S. would attack Russia through a direct war or a proxy war, NATO functions as a shield that greatly complicate Russia's ability to respond. This isn't about a singular scenario. It's about countless scenarios that Russia anticipates. Military empires are paranoid like that.\n\nRussia has been quite consistent in pointing at NATO, while our media is very inconsistent and produces clickbait soundbites about Russia's motives. It's also the most logical reason for why Russia would undertake such a costly war. It's true that Russia is opportunistic and would have liked to benefit from this war beyond kicking out NATO. But it remains logical that Russia was primarily concerned about the US/NATO. And if I'm wrong about that, then I'd still be very upset with NATO providing Russia with that excuse.\n\nI have no intention in playing with you though. This is not a game for me. I'm offering my perspective. If you disagree, that's fine and we can agree to disagree.

I consider the invasion criminal and immoral.\n\nThe United States, in its track record, has excused Russia's invasion. Because the United States has invaded countries posing less of a threat than Ukraine did to Russia, and the United States was willing to blow up the world over the Soviet Union building 'defences' against the U.S. in Cuba. Defences that were built precisely because of the United States violating Cuban sovereignty.\n\nYou're suggesting that the United States would allow advanced Chinese or Russian weapons in Mexico or Canada (or allow Mexico or Canada to join a Chinese or Russian military alliance). Every establishment politician in the United States, Mexico, Canada, China and Russia would laugh at the very notion that such a thing would ever be allowed by the United States. It flies in the face of all recent history.",

            "text": "Fiona Hill is a Washington insider who is very much pro NATO and anti-Russia. The quote is spot on, and it's also what Russia was expecting to happen. Russia quickly realized that Ukraine was stronger than anticipated (and their own army weaker), and sanctions were also worse than expected.\n\nFiona Hill also wrote:\n\n>According to multiple former senior U.S. officials we spoke with, in April 2022, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators appeared to have tentatively agreed on the outlines of a negotiated interim settlement: Russia would withdraw to its position on February 23, when it controlled part of the Donbas region and all of Crimea, and in exchange, Ukraine would promise not to seek NATO membership and instead receive security guarantees from a number of countries.\n\nShe didn't mention why the deal fell apart. But Pravda, a Ukrainian news platform (also very anti-Russian) said that Boris Johnson's visit changed the outcome of the negotiations by telling Ukraine it would not receive those security guarantees:\n\n>\"Johnson brought two simple messages to Kyiv. The first is that Putin is a war criminal; he should be pressured, not negotiated with. And the second is that even if Ukraine is ready to sign some agreements on guarantees with Putin, they are not. We can sign [an agreement] with you [Ukraine], but not with him. Anyway, he will screw everyone over\", is how one of Zelenskyy's close associates summed up the essence of Johnson's visit.\n\nUkraine was very much on its way to becoming a NATO member, either officially (which was difficult to achieve) or a de facto NATO member in all but name. Ukraine's army was receiving NATO training, NATO weapons, NATO intel and NATO funding. In 2020 it became an 'enhanced opportunity partner' of NATO and Ukraine started hosting NATO exercises on Ukrainian soil. Replace the word NATO with China and we'd all perceive Ukraine as a military arm of China. It takes effort not to understand why Russia would perceive Ukraine as a military arm of NATO.",

And the gain is that Russia wouldn't have to suffer a lot of economic and reputational damage, which it only understood once it invaded and things didn't go as smoothly as expected.\n\nWe've had various strong suggestions that Russia was willing to accept those conditions. For instance from the Ukrainian ambassador (Oleksandr Chalyi) as I just mentioned. Or last year there was U.S. insider Fiona Hill stating the same. And from the top of my head, there was a similar piece in Ukrainian media and the former Israeli Prime Minister also alluded to these events.\n\nI get why it's hard to grasp though. If it's true that Russia was willing to back down, then why wasn't the media all over it and why weren't our politicians constantly mentioning it? I understand that way of thinking, but I think we're severely underestimating how propagandistic our institutions are. Certainly not worse than in Russia, but not as radically different as we'd like to think.",

Around the same time as those negotiations, Boris Johnson boasted about visiting Kyiv and telling Ukraine not to negotiate. Ukraine then stepped away from the negotiations.\n\nAny deal Russia is willing to make now is far, far worse. And with U.S. support dropping, things may get worse still.",

I believe the only incomplete function right now is the IR sensor, which only works in a limited capacity. Of course there are also very few games that use it.\n\nThe connection strength of Joy-Cons absolutely sucks, which you need to compensate for by having a strong bluetooth adapter. A regular bluetooth dongle and many internal bluetooth adapters usually won't cut it, especially if you're going to use motion controls. A bluetooth dongle with antenna attached to it does work very well in my experience. And now my current motherboard came with a very good bluetooth antenna as well, which gives me a perfect connection.\n\nAnother issue with dongles is the Bluetooth version. In my experience and of some other people, Bluetooth 5.0+ dongles have an issue with Joy-Cons. While it doesn't affect signal strength, every time you turn off the Joy-Cons, you have to manually re-pair them with Windows when you turn them back on. It only takes a minute to re-pair them both, but it's rather annoying. With 4.0 dongles (and my motherboard), you only have to pair them once. After that you can turn them off and on without a problem.",

And after the overthrowal, the U.S. appeared to be closely involved in forming the next government, as per Nuland's leaked phone call. Even if U.S. actions were inconsequential to the overthrowal (highly unlikely), the U.S. went out of its way to look involved, while it knew very well that Russia would not tolerate its activities near its borders. And Russia responded by securing its most vital infrastructure in Ukraine, which was effectively already under Russian control and had a pro-Russian population.\n\nWhen they invaded in 2022, Ukraine was getting lots of military equipment and training from NATO. And it was hosting NATO exercises on its soil. Russia's biggest fear, NATO becoming a NATO member, was materializing.

They won't.\n\n>The lie that NATO is a threat to Russia is swallowed without thinking\n\nIt's swallowed by considering how the United States has always reacted to adversarial movements near its borders. It's called the golden rule.\n\n>Why did they do this?\n\nBecause they're in a difficult armed conflict in which they cannot spare any troops elsewhere.\n\n>where was the NATO argument in Georgia?\n\nThe NATO argument was there when the United States announced that Ukraine and Georgia would join NATO. The EU was terrified when the U.S. did that because it knew how Russia would take it. The current CIA director was too, warning his colleagues that U.S. behavior would provoke a Russian military response.\n\n>Ukraine can decide for themselves if they want peace\n\nThey cannot decide for themselves when they completely rely on our support/intel and when we pressure them not to negotiate. When Ukraine pursued peace, we didn't tell them to do what they believe is best. We told them to fight and sold them false promises.\n\n>he will just use that time to rearm before invading again\n\nThat depends entirely on the deal in place. I wouldn't propose Ukraine accepting a shitty peace deal. I'd propose brokering a proper deal with proper safeguards and guarantees that can be assured and verified. And I expect Russia to do what is in its selfish interests. Engaging in a proxy war with NATO in Ukraine is not in its interests.\n\nI'm aware of Russia's war crimes in Chechnya. As I am aware of American war crimes and Israeli war crimes. They're all apprehensible. It never warrants further warmongering and the pointless sacrificing of soldiers, civilians and resources.\n\nMaybe my worldview is warped, but it's quite a common view in Central/South America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. And now increasingly accepted in the U.S. and Europe as well. Critics of American wars are always accused of being traitorous or foolish in the beginning.

NATO members have been talking up Ukraine's chances in public, but we've seen from leaked U.S. documents that the picture is far more grim. It's a virtual stalemate. An extremely expensive one for both Russia and Ukraine.\n\nYou are correct that I have read stuff that told me the west wants to continue the Ukraine war and Putin wants to end it. Take Ukrainian ambassador Oleksandr Chalyi who personally negotiated a peace deal with Russia in April 2022. Just a few weeks ago he stated that he believes Putin regretted the invasion one week into it [probably because of the backlash and how poorly it went] and wanted to immediately resolve it. Around the same time the UK was boasting about telling Ukraine not to negotiate. The deal Russia wanted back then entailed Ukrainian military neutrality, while Crimea and the separatist territories would remain effectively under Russia's control (as before the invasion). Our leaders rejected it and now we're in a situation in which any potential deal looks far worse than that, while Ukraine and the world have suffered a lot of death and destruction just to get to this worse bargaining position.\n\nDo we really want to dig this hole even deeper?

It received lots of NATO weaponry and held NATO military exercises on Ukrainian soil. A potential solution was quite simple, namely for the U.S. and Ukraine to formally agree, with verifiable guarantees and safeguards, that Ukraine would not become a NATO ally or outpost.\n\nNo one could say with certainty that Russia would agree to a fair deal, but the problem is that we didn't try. Biden was shortly open to discussing it and Russia seemed very hopeful at that time, until Biden suddenly went back to the position that Ukraine's NATO status in non-negotiable, which heated things up again.\n\nI agree that it would be good if Russia would stop being an oppressive empire, as it would be good if the U.S. and China stopped as well.",

At best it can keep up this stalemate, but that comes at a very high price with no feasible rewards. Western leaders are increasingly worried that they're investing in a losing or pointless war. Populations are voting in leaders who are critical of the war (often far-right assholes). Even within Ukraine Zelenskyy is starting to lose face.\n\nWhat happened in Crimea was more complicated than a plain landgrab, as was the invasion. Both were illegal and the 2022 invasion was certainly immoral, but Russia had legitimate security concerns (according to U.S. principles) that the U.S. refused to respect. Of course Russia has been opportunistic in its response, but it didn't happen out of nowhere or out of sheer expansionist desires, as we like to believe.",

Preventing/stopping the war in Ukraine may have even prevented the election of various far-right parties in Europe, who of course don't care about climate change either.

This was widely discussed pre-invasion and became taboo after the invasion, because indeed in times of war, all inconvenient information is labeled hostile information.\n\n>You apparently labour under the belief that democratic countries should not be allowed to decide who they trade and cooperate with of their own accord\n\nI do not, but the U.S. and Russia do. That is the fucked up reality we live in. If we want to confront it, we should do so wisely and consistently. Not recklessly or hypocritically. Opposing the Russian empire without opposing the U.S. empire means you're not opposed to aggressive imperialism, you simply chose to side with one of the empires.\n\n>The vast majority of commanders and **boots on the ground** in the Donbas were Russian\n\nThat is interesting and I would be grateful if you have a source on that.\n\n>If all you have for \"America threatens Russia\" is a defensive alliance's expansion\n\nIf our empire considers adversarial expansion and advanced weapons pointed at it as threatening, then I must assume our adversaries find that threatening too. I can be in denial all I want, but the entire non-NATO world would laugh at the notion that Canada/Mexico could host Russian/Chinese weapons without being crushed. Unfortunately I am painfully aware that people within that NATO bubble refuse to own up to it, just as people in the Russian bubble refuse to see the criminality of their invasion.",

The U.S. media would have a field day, or rather a *field year* if they found such a phone call by Russian officials.\n\n>Ukrainians have a right to self determination\n\nAgreed, but if we want to make that argument we have to start with opposing our own governments from preventing the self-determination of numerous countries around the world. The U.S. does not respect the self-determination of a lot of countries, and would not allow Canada or Mexico to do whatever they want militarily either.\n\n>They overwhelming support Zelensky and the will to fight on to ultimate victory\n\nIn the face of direct violence from Russia, of course their primary concern was beating back Russia. Although you overestimate Ukraine's unanimity. In May 2023, a pro-Ukrainian anti-Russian media outlet (Vox Ukraine) polled Ukrainians and found that 29% of them saw the 2013 uprising as a coup, 26% thought Russia was in Ukraine to fight NATO and 25% thought the West was using Ukraine for its own purposes in the war against Russia. The percentages were higher among Ukrainians living abroad. More recently we've seen Kyiv's mayor turning against Zelensky, and Time quoting a close Zelensky aide calling Zelensky delusional.\n\nI'd say Russia and the U.S. are both devaluing Ukrainian lives and using them for their own selfish interests.\n\nThe risk Ukraine was in has been understood and discussed for decades. As an EU country, Finland didn't face any realistic risk. To put it bluntly, Finnish lives are worth a lot more to the West than Ukrainian lives and Russia knew that. It likely underestimated how much the West would sacrifice for Ukraine. It had nothing to gain and everything to lose by attacking Finland, for which it didn't even have a reason until Finland wanted to join NATO.\n\n>You mean like Mearsheimer\n\nLike the current director of the CIA. It wasn't just people critical of U.S. imperialism who saw it coming, but also typical cold-warriors.\n\nI consider Putin an authoritarian war criminal. He doesn't just dislike America, but he's emulating its foreign policy.",

None of us can say with certainty whether U.S. interference was or wasn't decisive in overthrowing Ukraine's government, but there were enough signs for Russia to consider it a U.S. backed coup.\n\nThere's one thing the U.S. could have done, which is to accept Russia's demand of Ukrainian neutrality instead of insisting that it would join NATO. Ukraine and the EU seemed very much willing to negotiate over that, both before and after the invasion. It's the U.S. that has been insisting that Ukraine must be weaponized against Russia. I don't know whether Russia would have accepted a proper deal that guaranteed Ukraine's sovereignty. It's appalling that we didn't try and chose to endanger Ukraine for the sake of U.S. geopolitical goals.\n\n>then all we have to do is look at the Finnish border\n\nOne major difference is that Russia could feasible stop Ukraine, and had no chance to stop Finland while it was already engaged in another difficult war. We'd like to think Finland joining NATO had no consequences, but it's possible that Finland's dumb symbolic action came at the cost of Ukrainian lives and land. To make up for the loss regarding Finland, Russia is only that much more determined to get a large victory in Ukraine.

Russia could sign a treaty blocking those weapons from being placed in Ukraine, but once Ukraine is in NATO those treaties aren't worth much. Russia wouldn't be able to invade anymore to do anything about it.\n\nHostile governments in Latin America are all being choked in one way or another and do not pose the slightest military threat to the United States. They wouldn't stand a chance joining a Russian or Chinese military alliance, especially neighboring countries.\n\nUkraine isn't a democracy to Russia. They saw the U.S. overtly and covertly interfering with Ukrainian politics and considered the overthrowal of the Ukrainian government as a U.S. backed coup (yes, Russia has been interfering in Ukrainian politics too). It can be debated to what extent it was U.S. interference and to what extent it was a popular uprising, but military empires never care for such nuances. For them the writing was on the wall. And the U.S. was aware of the risks. There's a memo of the current CIA director predicting exactly what would happen (a civil war followed by a Russian response) if the U.S. wasn't more careful.\n\nPersonally I don't believe the United States cares about human rights. It's buddies with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, etc. And it was fine with Saddam committing war crimes before too.

I was permabanned from one of Reddit's largest subreddits (r/worldnews) because I said Russia's criminal war is in line with U.S. principles (as in the U.S. would react the same in Russia's shoes). I took it to the site admins, who basically told me to fuck off and banned me site-wide for a few days. Of course no one was willing to explain why comparing Russian criminality to U.S. criminality was against the subreddits rules. They just said it was 'genocide denial', without saying how or why that's the case.\n\nOverall, I don't doubt that Reddit has more western, pro-NATO influences. A lot of people who are against NATO's role in Ukraine (many of which are also opposed to Russia's invasion) are sincerely against it. People opposed to the war in Vietnam were also accused of being traitors and secret operatives. And we see similar mechanics every war the U.S. engages in. Wars which tend to start with a lot of support and over time become unpopular. If people want to shut up inconvenient views now, they risk being on the same side as the 'patriots' who wanted to shut up Vietnam war critics, Iraq war critics, etc.\n\nAnd yes, Russia likely has influence ops like any other military empire and major geopolitical player in the world. They're not more sophisticated or effective than others. But the playing up the effectiveness of Russian propaganda is in itself anti-Russia propaganda. Likewise Russia likes to call its critics western infiltrators or says they're brainwashed by western propaganda. \n\nMeanwhile we also see an increase of people willingly isolating themselves from opposing narratives in general. They want to live in bubbles and can't handle competing information, so they simplify their world by dismissing any inconvenient views as malicious. Indeed there are various bubbles forming on Reddit with mods taking part in that. I've seen my pro-Palestinian allies on Reddit accusing me and others of being pro-Israel operatives for being critical of certain Palestinian narratives. We're becoming so narrow-minded and paranoid that we're turning against people who largely hold the same views.

            "text": "The West is starting to panic about Ukraine's chances for a reason. They're less capable of replenishing soldiers and ammo than Russia. The hugely hyped Ukrainian counter-offensive led to numerous casualties and an overall slight loss in territory. People are starting to realize that this is all our aid can accomplish: sustaining a bloody stalemate instead of giving Ukraine a fighting chance. A majority of Americans does not want to send more weapons. Europe is electing leaders critical of the war effort. Zelensky is losing face domestically. Kyiv's mayor turned against him. Time magazine is quoting close aides calling him delusional for thinking he can win.\n\nI find it sick to sacrifice Ukrainians for U.S. geopolitical games. I would like to support Ukraine without exploiting it for selfish gains. You keep conflating NATO's expansion goals with Ukraine's survival, which I get. The media in NATO countries have been conflating them too. But it never made any sense to refuse to consider a diplomatic solution in which Ukraine does not become a NATO outpost.",

The issue is that it's justified according to U.S. principles. As in the U.S. treated Russia in a way it would never accept being treated, and Russia responded as the U.S. would. Treating others in ways you do not tolerate being treated is a surefire way to create conflict, both in our personal lives and in international politics. It remains an unjustified response, but a predictable and preventable one.\n\nNeither do I intend to insinuate that Ukraine's security should be destroyed. Again, providing them with weapons is okay. But by insisting that Ukraine will become a NATO outpost, we are compromising Ukraine's security. We should have attempted to make a deal which protects Ukraine's security (with all the necessary guarantees and fail-safes) instead of holding on to irrational demands that endanger Ukraine. \n\nNow we're in the fucked up situation in which Russia has gained a lot of ground it can hold on to, without any realistic scenario for Ukraine to get it back. Throwing away even more Ukrainian lives and destabilizing the world even more won't change that. The U.S. abandoning Ukraine after promising it the moon is very fucked up, but it's even more fucked up to keep doubling down.",

And while the U.S. would never allow an adversarial military empire near its borders (see the Cuban Missile Crisis), we laughed away Russia's security concerns and insisted that Russia must accept an adversarial military empire on its borders.\n\nIt's not like we couldn't predict what would happen. The current CIA director warned his colleagues that U.S. activities in Ukraine could lead to a civil war and an eventual Russian response, which is precisely what happened when we kept doubling down.\n\nAnd all this happened in a larger context of decades-long NATO expansion, and Bush announcing that Ukraine and Georgia (the most sensitive spots for Russia) would follow. Not to mention the ill-effects of U.S. politicians trying to score political points by boasting how tough they were or would be against Russia. \n\nI've never been opposed to providing Ukraine with weapons to fend off Russian invaders, even though the U.S. helped create the war. However I am opposed to providing Ukraine with weapons to fight for the right to become a NATO outpost. That's not good for Ukraine and not good for the world. Rather it just assures that Russia will continue to consider Ukraine as an existential threat. \n\nThere's been several reports now suggesting that Russia was willing to cease its invasion if it was agreed that Ukraine would not join NATO. Yes, Russia would still have Crimea and perhaps some pro-Russian Donbas parts. But by following NATO objectives, Ukraine is in a much worse position and stands to get way less at a far higher cost. Ukraine loses. Russia loses.  Europe loses. The developing world loses. The U.S. is fine, because it was able to weaken its adversary and increase its grip on Europe.",

Although they were facing an inherent threat, because being taken hostage by armed people means you are being threatened.\n\nIf the hostages don't speak out in large numbers, we won't know what that means. There are plenty of plausible explanations and it's foolish to pick the one we find most convenient to our cause. \n\nThere are Thai hostages who have claimed that Jewish hostages faced harsher conditions and were beaten. My guess is that the term Jewish is (erroneously) being used interchangeably with the term Israeli, and it is plausible that Israelis, perhaps specifically Israeli adult men, were treated far worse than other hostages. Maybe they were military personnel, maybe not. Maybe the Thai hostages were promised rewards by Israel to make this statement and they lied about or distorted what happened.\n\nAlthough perhaps all of this is irrelevant to discuss under this post.

They're in combat and people in combat always lie if they believe it furthers their chances at winning. Likewise Israel has every motivation to lie. Both are very unreliable parties.\n\nDo I believe people were beheaded, raped, mutilated and tortured? At least the latter three are pretty much an inherent part of war, so I can believe it happened. As far as I know, there's no footage of many of those claims, so I won't pretend to know it for a fact or know the scope of it. But it's obvious many innocent civilians were killed. To know the exact details of what happened will take time and independent research. Israeli accusations without definitive proof are worthless.\n\nI was similarly skeptical of the Ahli Arab hospital strike. Unlike many of my peers, I did not assume it was an Israeli bomb responsible (nor did I assume the opposite). I had no opinion on the death toll. Gaza officials said 500. U.S. intelligence estimated 100-300.

On one hand, they are just willing to do anything that refocuses the world's attention on them. On the other hand, it might just be a twisted, deranged way of getting back at the world, like a school shooter. As for the Hamas leadership, they expect to benefit from chaos and from Palestinians being killed. They're in an ugly symbiotic relationship with Israelis leaders, as Palestinian terror empowers Israeli elites and Israeli terror empowers Palestinian elites.\n\nTo be effective they must spread out. And to spread out means being among civilians in such a densely populated area. That's their only way to fight. We can also ask ourselves why the Vietcong hid among civilians, which had far more space to hide. Desperate people employ desperate tactics. That doesn't mean the U.S. should have wiped out villages.

Of course it was also in a different context, because he certainly wouldn't refer to Hamas leaders as friends now. But he, like Jimmy Carter, did what he could to increase the likelihood of peace. People go easier on Jimmy because he's far less of a threat to the political establishment.\n\nAnd to be mad at Jeremy for calling people from Hamas friends one or two times in the past, while ignoring political leaders saying they unconditionally support Israel while it is slaughtering civilians, does not make sense to me. Frankly that is the equivalent of Jeremy saying he unconditionally supports Hamas right after Oct. 7, which is the opposite of what he has said.",

There was no peace. There was a brutal system of apartheid and occupation. As you said yourself, \"there is never any justification for the atrocities Hamas and Russia have committed\". All you have to do is hold Israel to the same standards.\n\n>I seriously wonder how you think Israel should have responded to October 7\n\nThe moment something like October 7 happens, it's already too late. Israel should have heeded the many warnings that their occupation and apartheid system were unsustainable, instead of waiting for the shit to hit the fan. Once it did hit the fan, there were already more Hamas fighters killed than Israelis. Israel should have first struck with precision where it could. And it should have negotiated the release of its kidnapped civilians. Most importantly, it needs a vision of peace that is actually feasible, instead of a vision of eternal suffering for the Palestinians. But I won't pretend that this would be easy for Israel, because they should have been proactive and not reactive. They squandered Gaza's peaceful protests in 2018 and got an ultraviolent protest instead.\n\n>It\u2019s their decision whether to call for genocide\n\nCool, so only offer consequences for the protesters who call for genocide instead of for everyone. Likewise if some Israeli protestors say Gaza should be turned into a parking lot, that should not be the cause for all Israeli protests to be criminalized.",

If you cared about genocide, you'd care about Palestinians.\n\nThis wasn't all caused by Hamas. Hamas is a response to a long occupation. Not a desirable or righteous response, but a typical and predictable one. Which is why so many people, including some Israelis, have been warning in the years before this attack that situation in Gaza was unsustainable. And instead of rethinking things, Israel is tripling down on the same criminal strategy that has failed over and over again.\n\nWho gets to decide what all pro-Palestine protests call for, and what all pro-Israeli protests don't?",

By smugness I mean thinking you can become president just because the other guy sucks, and not putting in an effort for a huge chunk of voters who felt disenfranchised and felt let down by Obama (who they voted for before voting for Trump).\n\nTrump voters did soak up Trump's lies, but their choice was between his lies and Hillary's lies. So obviously they'd just pick whichever lie aligns more with their views. I believe Democrats would have been more successful if they offered something sincere. At least some Republicans and especially independents would have been swayed.\n\nIf people wanted to protest vote, the obvious question to ask is why they disliked Hillary so much that they didn't want to vote. And why the Democratic party insisted on pushing someone forward who was so negatively received by the country. Trump and Hillary were both strongly disliked from the start. People's hatred for Hillary was transformed into approval of Trump. And people's hatred for Trump was transformed into approval of Hillary. But they were both emblematic for the broken democratic system of the United States.

The Ottomans rule is a nice historic fact, but it is only logical to put more of an emphasis on more recent interference. And since the subject is Europeans whining about immigration from the region, European influence on the region is especially relevant. It is absurd not to draw lines between the West supporting Islamists and those Islamists becoming more powerful. As well as extremist groups coming to power in the wake of our wars.

It would be easier if you had a Dutch connection to help you out a bit. Real estate people will try to get a lot more out of you. The other things will mostly be cheaper or the same in Amsterdam as what you mentioned.\n\n- Not speaking Dutch is largely fine. Most people will accommodate you. Some people might give you a hard time if they feel like you're not trying, so it helps a lot to just learn the most basic phrases.\n\n- It's fairly safe if you don't happen to get unlucky with where you live. It's not safe enough to completely let your guard down, but common sense is enough for most people to stay out of trouble.\n\n- Meeting people as a foreigner is hard compared to many places in the world, but I don't know how it compares to Scandinavia. There are plenty of internationals (and some Dutch people) in the same boat as you willing to connect, but it can take effort.\n\n- I'd say Dutch people are pretty rude and somehow both close-minded and open-minded at the same time. They're not especially kind, but as with any group, generalizations only work to a limited extent. One major upside is that in work settings, things can be less formal and less hierarchic.",

If however I make the claim that my great great great great great great great grandfather had his home taken away from him and that I deserve to return there, most rational people would assume I have a screw loose.\n\nPoint to the European equivalent of the West Bank or Gaza and I will indeed argue that certain European lands should be returned. Indeed there were many territorial concessions throughout/after WW2 and some of them may have been wrongful, but which countries lost the majority of their territory while millions of people live on the tiny leftovers under control by another government? With each border that was changed, we can ask the question whether it created a humanitarian disaster that can be improved by changing it back (partially or fully), or whether the situation has already stabilized. There's no need to fix something if it ain't broke.",

They had the correct legal backing and the natives lacked the papers to give them ownership of their territories.\n\nThe natives kept attacking the Europeans who encroached upon their land and continuously expanded. Never mind that their own casualties kept being way higher. Every time the natives attacked, it was out of the blue. Every time the settlers attacked, it was a justified response. It's quite ridiculous to think like that and see the settlers as the victims of native aggression, but looking at it through the eyes of a settler who greatly benefits from this system and who heard about white people being brutally murdered, it makes perfect sense to believe you're a victim.\n\nThe U.S. did try to keep the peace by making deals and signing treaties. Sometimes one tribe or another, or a faction within them didn't accept the scraps they were given and attacked. And all natives faced the consequences for it. Meanwhile there were also settlers who didn't respect the treaties and the American government was unable or unwilling to keep them in line. I'm sure the savage natives being pushed into each other's territories also fought among each other. That's always been a common consequence of forced displacement.\n\nKeep in mind there are Palestinians all across the world who are upstanding citizens and assimilated into their host countries very well. Many of them probably came from families that were better off and had access to education. Whereas the poor and uneducated who live under the most dire circumstances are more likely to be radicalized. It's not that hard to understand, but it's even easier to ascribe to racist theories.",

They might hire people to specifically check if the generated content is breaking any copyrights, though soon enough AI can also determine for itself whether its creations are different enough from the source material to be considered unique.",

That doesn't mean they get to call the shots now (although they surely deserve better treatment).\n\nThe Jewish people of the territory have every right to live in any state formed there. They didn't have a special right to statehood. And if they did, it should have been for the Jewish minority living there and be proportionally assigned, as opposed to creating a nation for Jewish people from all over the world to come to. Only religious zealots would come up with such an insane idea. The people living there under British rule should have gotten self-determination, instead of the British deciding for them how to live and who to live with (in part due to pressure from Zionist terrorist groups).\n\nThe recognition that Israel is illegally expanding and oppressing the natives is not anti-semitic whatsoever. Which is why there's plenty of Jewish people around the world highly critical of Israel and deeply troubled by Israel's wrongful insistence that it represents the Jewish people. Within Israel there's also a decent amount of Jewish people (certainly a minority) opposed to Israel's treatment of Palestinians. \n\nYour description of adult states and toddler states is a nice euphemism for civilized people and savages. Of course progressives see through that language and understand what you're really saying: the savages must make way for the civilized. Each violent reaction by the native savages is due to their savagery, and each violent reaction by the civilized is due to necessity. We've inflicted huge amounts of suffering across the world through this twisted and irrational way of thinking. And we still didn't learn from it.",

            "text": "When everything that is inconvenient gets labeled Russian propaganda, discourse becomes impossible. All my arguments were a regular part of the discourse before 2022. If they weren't Russian propaganda then (because they were uttered by U.S. and EU academics, diplomats and politicians), they aren't now.\n\n>So when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014 in violation of the Budapest Memorandum, international laws, and a number of treaties, agreements, and accords it signed with Ukraine since 1991? No arguing with that.\n\nGo back a few months and Ukraine's government was overthrown, from Russia's perspective by a U.S. backed coup. Which is not hard to conceive considering U.S. politicians enthusiastically flew over to support the anti-government protests, had been funding anti-government media for over a decade and were caught on tape seemingly deciding who would run Ukraine. And add to that a long recorded history of the U.S. doing exactly that in country after country. Russia criminally, yet predictably responded by securing vital military infrastructure in Ukraine. The mentality of Russia can be easily comprehended because it mirrors the mentality of the United States. And because of that, it could also be conceived how a war could be averted. The EU, Russia and Ukraine all tried to some extent to work it out. The U.S. did not and took an anti-diplomatic stance.\n\n>But another thing that increases risk of nuclear holocaust is to give into demands of a nuclear terrorist\n\nThat entirely depends on the demands. Demanding not to have advanced U.S. weapons placed near the Russian border is an acceptable demand. As did we all accept the U.S. dictating that the Soviet Union couldn't place its advanced weapons in Cuba. We don't have to agree with the demand or like it, but we can accept it.\n\nThis is how rational people behave. If someone puts a gun to your head and demands that you stop creepily standing around near their home every night, you ought to comply even if you technically have the right to be there. If they put a gun to your head and ask for your wallet, you ought to give it to them. Or at least you should the first one or two times before taking a stand. If they put a gun to your head and demand your home and livelihood, you might decide to take a stand immediately. Only hotheaded fools decide to risk their life over their momentary pride, or a wallet.",

If the U.S. invades a country to spread 'democracy', you do not have definitive prove that the U.S. is lying about spreading democracy because it is supporting dictators elsewhere. You have an argument. People who disagree with you and say that the U.S. really is trying spread democracy should not be censored because they're opposing 'facts'. They may be ignorant and may have weaker arguments than you, but they're not wrong in a definitive way.

They're not solely in the margins, but can successfully pressure politicians and institutions. That doesn't mean they're all-powerful or that they're ruling Ukraine, but they are a factor. It was significant enough for most EU countries and the U.S. to be worried, and for the mainstream press to report on those concerns. Expressing those exact same concerns now has become taboo.

In the article, Hasan claims he really did get a letter with powder. His description in the interview is sloppy, but it aligns with what he's saying in the new interview. He probably meant to say \"I thought it was filled with anthrax\". He's not necessarily lying, because he can safely assume that everyone knows it wasn't real anthrax. Otherwise that would have been worldwide news and he'd be saying he was almost killed.\n\nWas he exaggerating during the interview about how scared he was of that letter and how that motivated him? Most likely he did, which is something most celebrities and public figures probably do. They turn their life into an inspiring, meaningful story, even though real life is a lot more random and harder to pin down.

The only thing you get in cars is privacy, though long-distance trains can have private cabins too. It's spoiled, anti-social behavior to demand privacy every time you move around. In a healthy society, people don't mind shortly sharing the same space with others.\n\nPublic transit doesn't need to be more of a hassle than cars at all. It can be, but if can also be far more convenient and relaxing. It completely depends on the quality of the infrastructure and the density of the city. When we put the same amount of resources in both in a city with a large population, public transportation will easily be the more convenient option. Especially when we also account for the hidden costs of private transportation, such as medical bills from air pollution, obesity and crashes.",

            "text": "My point remains steady. Ukraine got significantly closer to NATO accession when a pro-west US-friendly group overthrew the government. Russia was understandably worried about that. I didn't say Ukraine was on the verge of joining NATO, nor did I dispute that Ukraine became way closer to joining NATO after the annexation of Crimea.\n\nYou don't have to believe the U.S. is fearful of Cuba now. But I reckon you stand alone in claiming the U.S. was not fearful of Soviet nukes in Cuba. Or fearful of Soviet actions in general. I'd say oftentimes it's a mixture of legitimate concerns and opportunism. I think the U.S. was worried about the Soviet Union, but also wanted to subjugate and exploit countries. I think Russia was worried about NATO enlargement in Ukraine, but also wanted to subjugate Ukraine (again). I think our expansionist stance at worst caused the Ukraine war and at best provided Russia with an excuse. Both are bad and should have been prevented.",

Doesn't apply to me.\n\nThe phone call and the money and the American politicians flying over are substantial. My guess is you would think so too if it was Russian/Chinese activity in Mexico or Canada. And more importantly, the U.S. government would think so.\n\n>The pro-US person who came in after Yanukovich was NOT pro-NATO.\n\nThat's because you're making a distinction between NATO and the United States. But NATO is just an extension of the U.S. empire. Russia wasn't worried about NATO as a whole either. It's worried about what NATO represents, which is U.S. power.\n\n>US does not fear Cuba. US does not fear China. North Korea does not fear anyone either. All of these countries feel safe because they have NUKES. What they do is they LIE that they feel unsafe\n\nYour take on the cold war and modern history is at least highly original and unconventional, I'll give you that. It flies in the face of everything we're taught at universities and in the media, but I can appreciate your bold interpretation. It's funny how we started out this conversation as if I was the person differing from the mainstream.",

            "text": "It has been proven that the U.S. has backed coups and interfered in foreign elections in the past. And the U.S. has also publicly cheered on some of those same movements they privately supported/directed in the past. It's not crazy to suggest that something that has happened many times before has happened again. It's embarrassing to see you telling me to 'get a grip' while you contest world history and all the official documentation we have. Doubly so on a Chomsky subreddit.\n\nThe phone call and the U.S. influence operations (for instance by the National Endowment of Democracy) are strong indicators that history has repeated itself. I don't speak in absolutes on certainties, but I can make educated guesses.\n\nIf Ukraine was as you said controlled by a Russian patsy, and that patsy was replaced by a pro EU person who NATO wanted to be in power, that does also in fact mean Ukraine was closer to NATO than it was before. It's not hard to understand why Russia would be incredibly worried after the coup, unless you try very hard not to understand.\n\nThe U.S. sanctioned Russia pretty severely after the annexation. Trump started sending lethal aid and tore down major treaties with Russia. All the while the U.S. laughed off Russia's security concerns, even though the U.S. wouldn't tolerate the same threats near its own borders.\n\nWhy would Russia accept defeat and make the U.S. victorious when it's not in its interest to do so? Moreover, it puts Putin and his allies in mortal danger for having started a war with huge losses and zero gains. So yes, I wish Russia would retreat. But it's a fantasy in which Russia does something our side would never do. I don't know why people keep expecting Russia to be better than us. I don't hold Russia in such high regard.\n\nIt's mind-boggling to see people pretend that nukes make countries immune from threats. Does the U.S. and its population not fear an adversarial Cuba with nukes? Does North Korea feel safe because it has nukes? It's an absolutely ridiculous notion.\n\nAnd no, I do not think I am correct just for having differing views. I do think it's healthy to be extra skeptical of information that is convenient to us or to our empire (again, this is a Chomsky subreddit). At the end of the day, I go with evidence and logic.",

            "text": "Representatives flying over to show their support for the protesters who end up overthrowing the government is incredibly suspicious, especially for a country with a long and recent history of supporting dissidents to overthrow governments. The U.S. had already stated its objective to include Ukraine in NATO. And it has also been funding Ukrainian activists and media institutions that align with its goals for several decades. And then on top of that, we get the leaked phone call that perfectly fits the MO. There is no definitive proof there, but based on what we know it's far more likely that they were significantly involved than that they weren't.\n\nBeing closer to the United States means being closer to NATO. The two cannot be separated.\n\nThe EU was desperate to have diplomacy with Russia, in part because the EU had a lot to gain from Russian resources. The U.S. was not happy to ignore the annexation of Crimea. Obama was (rightfully) concerned and took a step back, though there were sanctions. Trump took on a much more aggressive stance and Biden continued that anti-diplomatic trend. Things have changed for the EU now. Its leaders are fully on board with the United States. Russia assumes that even if it would retreat, the U.S. and EU would continue with harsh sanctions and the EU would continue to move away from Russian gas. I expect Russia would be correct in that assumption.\n\nThe U.S. leaves countries that cannot threaten it. If Afghanistan could cripple the U.S. with sanctions or threaten it militarily, the United States would not leave. The same goes for Vietnam and any other country the U.S. has left. The U.S. would not let Cuba host advanced Soviet weapons, because that's a direct and severe threat to U.S. security.\n\nRussians who believe in Russian propaganda will also claim that it's simply reality. That's the mindset you share with them. I'd like to think I have more in common with Russian dissidents who see through their own empire's propaganda.",

The new government was pro-West, which certainly brought Ukraine closer to NATO.\n\nI also think the claim that NATO countries are conspiring to divide up Russia for its natural resources is a bit of a stretch. But it's not a stretch to assume that Ukraine would be used as a stepping stone to slowly choke Russia in a regime change effort. As it does with North Korea, Cuba and Iran. \n\nRussia's nukes do not keep it entirely safe from heavy foreign interference. And your statement elsewhere that Russia can just leave at any time is also rather disingenuous. The consequences for Russia would be severe. Yes they should leave, but the U.S. wouldn't do so under the same circumstances so it's rather unrealistic.\n\nOf course reading Russian propaganda helps us understand the conflict far better than solely reading western propaganda.",
